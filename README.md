Aim

The aim of this project was to design and prototype a modular, semi-autonomous lawnmower system capable of performing basic mowing functions with minimal human intervention. The system would combine precise motor control, basic obstacle avoidance, and user guided learning capabilities, all implemented using accessible microcontrollers and simulation tools. An emphasis was placed on practical feasibility, future scalability, and adherence to sound engineering practices, including EMI protection, signal integrity, and modular subsystem design.

Results

The project successfully demonstrated the three core subsystems of an autonomous lawnmower:

A proof-of-concept encoder based control logic for navigation sequencing.
A Tinkercad simulated drive and obstacle detection system using DC motors and ultrasonic sensing.
A fully functional ESP32 based “learning mode” web interface running on real hardware.

While complete integration of all components in a single testbed was not possible due to simulation platform limitations, each subsystem was independently validated and conceptually unified through design documentation. Additional hardware-level considerations, including but not only EMI shielding, RF management, and robust power supply design were incorporated, underscoring the project’s product-oriented mindset. The result is a strong foundation for developing a complete, reliable, and scalable robotic lawnmower.
